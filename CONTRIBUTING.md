## Adding a new layer

The library consists of multiple layers. It needs to add several other layers. There are issues pertaining to [new layers](https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-environmental-layers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Anew-layer). 

### Steps to add a new layer :
1. Find an issue labelled <i>new layer</i>.
2. Go through the documentaion provided to understand how the API works.
3. Here's a codepen example that consists of a base layer and [Luftdaten Layer](https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-environmental-layers/issues/88) as an overlay. You can check its full implementation [here](https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-environmental-layers/pull/137).

### Some sample PRs to be referred for adding new layers:
